ETL: extract transformed load 

TRUNCATE TABLE (Transact-SQL) Removes all rows from a table or specified partitions of a table, without logging the individual row deletions. TRUNCATE TABLE is similar to the DELETE statement with no WHERE clause; however, TRUNCATE TABLE is faster and uses fewer system and transaction log resources.

TRUNCATE friends IF EXISTS;
DROP TABLE friends;
